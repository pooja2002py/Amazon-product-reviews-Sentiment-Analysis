# 🛒 Amazon Product Reviews - Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model that accurately classifies customer reviews as:

- ✅ Positive
- ❌ Negative

By analyzing customer feedback, businesses can:

- ✔️ Gain insights into consumer preferences  
- ✔️ Improve product offerings  
- ✔️ Enhance customer satisfaction

## 📂 Dataset

### 📌 Dataset Source  
Amazon Product Reviews Dataset (Amazon Fine Food Reviews)

The dataset contains:
- Review Text
- Ratings
- Review Summary
- Product information

---

## 🛠 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- ✔️ Handling missing values  
- ✔️ Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters  
- ✔️ Tokenization  
- ✔️ Lemmatization  
- ✔️ Text vectorization  

#### Vectorization Techniques Used:
- TF-IDF  
- Word2Vec  
- BERT Embeddings (optional advanced implementation)  

---

### 2️⃣ Handling Imbalanced Data

Real-world review datasets are often skewed toward positive ratings.

Techniques used:

- ✔️ Under-sampling (removing excess positive reviews)  
- ✔️ Over-sampling (optional)  
- ✔️ SMOTE (optional)  

---

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- ✔️ Distribution of Ratings and Sentiments  
- ✔️ Word Clouds for Positive Reviews  
- ✔️ Word Clouds for Negative Reviews  
- ✔️ Top Frequent Words in each sentiment category  

---

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model

#### 🔹 Traditional Model
- Naive Bayes  

#### 🔹 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix
